# Short Stories API
Handles all the CRUD requests that comes from the frontend. This API is for creating or logging in users, getting a list of public stories, and creating, editing, and deleting stories.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JWT

I used Express to simplify endpoint creation and functionality and MongoDB was my database of choice since it's data that doesn't really need structure like with a relational database. I used JWT for authentication as I found it was the most popular method of authentication with a React front end

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to use JWT to authenticate on the back end
